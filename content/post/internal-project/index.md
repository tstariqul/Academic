Every day I received numbers of massages regarding application procedure to Erasmus+: Erasmus Mundus Scholarship, This might help all.  

*1st. Erasmus Mundus joint master programs are fully funded by European Union and usually master programs are divided between 2 or more countries.

*2nd. There are 60+ different programs in Erasmus+, each program has their own requirements. Go through this link: https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-plus/library/scholarships-catalogue_en   you will find all the programs and program websites. Go through PROGRAM websites those about requirements, application processes and datelines.
****most of the websites has FAQ sections, read those sections. You will get 90% of your questions answered there.

*3rd. you can apply in 3 programs max in one year . Common requirement : a)Educational documents( Certificates and Transcripts) b)CV c) Motivation letter d)Recommendation letters (usually 2 needed) e) IELTS.
*****Requirements varies Program to program, Follow the program website.
***ABOUT IELTS: If your medium of instruction in University is English then in some programs you may don’t need IELTS SCORE, if so then it must be mentioned on a document provide by your university that your medium of instruction is English.
Some Common Question that people asked me:  
1. My CGPA is not that high should I apply??  
ANS: Yes!! Why not? I have seen many people getting scholarship with medium CGPA.  
2. How is the student selection performed??  
ANS: ****Every Program has its different Criteria and selection rules, follow the program website.
In my program Medical Imaging and Applications (http://maiamaster.udg.edu/) MAIA , What they write in the Reply to this question in their FAQ is given below

How is the student selection performed?
The final mark is obtained as a weighted sum of: (i) your CPGA and CV, (ii) your motivation letter reviewed by two members of the consortium independently, and (iii) your evaluation from the two referees you select (they fill in a questionnaire and send us a reference letter which is again evaluated from two members of the consortium). With all this information, we obtain a final mark of each student and do the ranking, taking the nationality rules (only two from the same country) into account.
****Every Program has its different Criteria and selection rules, follow the program website
3. I don’t have any publication. Should I Apply?  ANS: Neither do I have any publication. Having publications is always a plus point but not mandatory.
***working experience on similar fields added value to your application.    
4. What Should I focus  in SOP??  
ANS: read the program website more than five times, try to understand what does program want in a potential participant. Figure those things out first.  Next thing would be making your SOP in that way that the reader would feel you have those things in you, and your CV would be the brief version of your motivation letter.  For example: your CV would be Index of your book and your Motivation will have intro>> about you, details>>> about your skills>>showing your interest to the sub>> last the conclusion why u are the IDEAL CANDIDATE for this program this program.

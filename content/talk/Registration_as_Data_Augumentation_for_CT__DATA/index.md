abstract: "Main idea of this project was making some new data using simple registration technique from existing CT data. This code be a possible alternative of arbitrary augmentation such as flip, rotation, zoom etc. A simple but powerful non-rigid registration technique BSpline is been used for this. There are number of parameters that can be used to make the variation of the registration to make new data which is completely different from Moving and Fixed CT used for registration."

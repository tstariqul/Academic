abstract: "s  the  learning  rate  is  one  of  the  most  importanthyper-parameters  to  tune  for  training  convolutional  neural  net-works.  In  this  paper,  a  powerful  technique  to  select  a  range  oflearning rates for a neural network that named cyclical learningrate  was  implemented  with  two  different  skewness  degrees.  Itis  an  approach  to  adjust  where  the  value  is  cycled  between  alower bound and upper bound. CLR policies are computationallysimpler and can avoid the computational expense of fine tuningwith  fixed  learning  rate.  It  is  clearly  shown  that  changing  thelearning  rate  during  the  training  phase  provides  by  far  betterresults than fixed values with similar or even smaller number of epochs."

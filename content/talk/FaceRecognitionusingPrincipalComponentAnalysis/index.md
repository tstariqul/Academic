abstract: Few years back, face recognition is only limited to personal identification, now this technology is been grown in the field of security, healthcare, personalized services etc. Many methods are developed to perform for face recognition and they work quit well.The basic idea of this project it to compute a data set of features from the face images ùêºùëûwhich have compared with a set of database images ùêº1‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ùêºùëû to detect the best match. Every pixel can be considered as a variable that means the dimensional space is very high. PCA is been used to decreasing the dimensionality of the image for making this recognition problem easier.

abstract: "The idea of the project is to apply 2D U-net to Segment the RIO using the publicly
available data from ISIC Challenge 2017 and classification of the segmented region for
classification of lesion. Multiple OTS model ( Resnet, VGG, Densenet) were used for classification. Among the model VGG out performed all other model. Ensembling of the models was also applied and performed better than single classifier, Democracy always wins."

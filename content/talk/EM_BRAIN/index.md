abstract: "The segmentation is an essential part of many computer vision systems and medical applications. The goal is to divide an input image into a set of non-overlapping regions which union is the entire image. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative technique designed for probabilistic models. Expectation-Maximization algorithm for segmenting brain MRI images (T1-w image) into the three main tissues: white matter (WM), grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)."
